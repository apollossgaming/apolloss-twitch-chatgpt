When apolloss_gaming types in '!battle' start a game where a dark wizard spawns in the chat, with 100 health. Everytime a viewer attacks the monster by typing '!attack' it will hit the monster anywhere from 1 to 10 damage. Each viewer during the battle starts out with 100 health, the dark wizard will attack anyone else back for anywhere from 10 to 15 damage. The dark wizard also has a 30% chance to obsorb the viewers attack with a magic shield around him. Once the dark wizard is down to 0 health, it dies and whichever player is still alive with the most damage gets 100 MysticPoints. Let everyone know after the game ends that this game is under development and will get better in the next few weeks with more features.
